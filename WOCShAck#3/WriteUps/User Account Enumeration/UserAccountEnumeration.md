# Description
It is possible to enumerate usernames in the web application using the error message generated by the password recovery function.

# Exploitation
Access the URL that allows resetting a password. 
- When an **invalid** username is entered, the web application informs that the user does not exist.

- When a **valid** username is entered, the application indicates that an email has been sent to the user's email address.

# Risk
An attacker can enumerate existing users in the application by using a dictionary file of usernames or through brute force of possible usernames.

# Remediation
Do not display error messages that indicate whether a user exists or not. Instead, show a generic message such as "If the user exists, an email to reset the password will be sent."
